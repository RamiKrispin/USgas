The **USgas** package provides an overview of demand for natural gas in the US in a time-series format. That includes the following dataset:
* `usgas` - The monthly consumption of natural gas in the US/state level by end-use since 1973 for US level and 1989 for state level. It includes the following end-use categories:
   - Commercial Consumption
   - Delivered to Consumers
   - Electric Power Consumption
   - Industrial Consumption
   - Lease and Plant Fuel Consumption
   - Pipeline Fuel Consumption
   - Residential Consumption
   - Vehicle Fuel Consumption

The package also includes the following datasets, from previous release:

* `us_total` - The US annual natural gas consumption by state-level between 1997 and 2019, and aggregate level between 1949 and 2019
* `us_monthly` - The monthly demand for natural gas in the US between 2001 and 2020
* `us_residential` - The US monthly natural gas residential consumption by state and aggregate level between 1989 and 2020

The `us_total`, `us_monthly`, and `us_residential` can be derived out of the `usgas` dataset. Therefore, those datasets in the process of deprication and will be removed in the next release to CRAN.

Data source: The US Energy Information Administration [API](https://www.eia.gov/)

## The usgas dataset

The `usgas` dataset provides a 313 time series focusing on the consumption of natural gas by end use in the US (aggregated and state level). It includes the following fields:

- `date` - A Date, the month and year of the observation (the day set by default to 1st of the month)}
- `process` - The process type description
- `state` -  The US state name
- `state_abb` - The US state abbreviation
- `y` - A numeric, the monthly natural gas residential consumption in a million cubic feet

```{r}
library(USgas)

data("usgas")

str(usgas)

head(usgas)
```

The dataset includes the state level and the US aggregate level (labeled under `U.S.`):

```{r}
unique(usgas$state)
```

In the example below, we will subset and plot the consumption by end-use in the US:

```{r }
us_agg <- usgas[which(usgas$state == "U.S."),]

head(us_agg)
```

Let's now use **plotly** to plot those series:

```{r}
library(plotly)

plot_ly(data = us_agg,
        x = ~ date,
        y = ~ y,
        color = ~ process,
        type = "scatter",
        mode = "line") |> 
  layout(title = "US Monthly Consumption of Natural Gas by End Use",
         yaxis = list(title = "MMCF"),
         xaxis = list(title = "Source: EIA Website"),
         legend = list(x = 0,
                       y = 0.95))
```

Similarly, we can subset a couple of states and visualize them. For example, letâ€™s visualize the residential consumption in the New England states. We will start by subsetting the corresponding states in New England, transform the data.frame to wide format, and reorder by date:

```{r}
ne <- c("Connecticut", "Maine", "Massachusetts",
        "New Hampshire", "Rhode Island", "Vermont")
ne_gas <-  usgas[which(usgas$state %in% ne),]

head(ne_gas)

```


Next, let's use the `process` column to extract the residential consumption and plot it:

```{r}
ne_gas[which(ne_gas$process == "Residential Consumption"),] |>
  plot_ly(x = ~ date,
          y = ~ y,
          color = ~ state,
          type = "scatter",
          mode = "line") |> 
  layout(title = "Monthly Residential Consumption of Natural Gas in New England",
         yaxis = list(title = "MMCF"),
         xaxis = list(title = "Source: EIA Website"),
         legend = list(x = 0,
                       y = 1))
```
